#inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes that we derive from are called base classes. Important benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors).
#syntax of inheritance
#class base_class:
#    #code block
#    #code block
#    #code block
#class derived_class(base_class):
#    #code block
#    #code block
#    #code block

#example of inheritance
class inherit():
    name = "suagr"
    age = 20
    gender = 'male'
