"""
if you notice when we submitted the form the words were in the url
this is becausewe did not spciify the method of the form
in forms there are two methods get and post
GET requests data from a specified resource it is used when we are not passing any important information
POST submits data to be processed to a specified resource it is used when we are passing important information
it secures the data from the user so put post method in the form

{% csrf_token %} add this code to the form in the counter.html file

The error you're encountering occurs because Django is trying to automatically add a trailing slash (`/`) to the URL, but it cannot maintain the POST data during the redirect. Here are a few ways to solve this issue:

### 1. **Add a Trailing Slash to the URL in the Form Action**
Update the form's action in your HTML template to include a trailing slash:

```html
<form action="/counter/" method="POST">
    <!-- Your form inputs -->
</form>
```

This way, when the form is submitted, Django wonâ€™t need to redirect the URL.

### 2. **Set `APPEND_SLASH=False` in Django Settings**
You can also disable Django's automatic behavior of adding a trailing slash by setting `APPEND_SLASH=False` in your Django settings file (`settings.py`):

```python
# settings.py
APPEND_SLASH = False
```

However, it's recommended to keep `APPEND_SLASH=True` (which is the default) and use the first approach, as having consistent URLs with a trailing slash can be beneficial for routing.

### 3. **Use `@require_POST` or `@csrf_exempt` if Necessary**
If you have specific logic that deals with GET vs. POST requests, ensure that your views are correctly handling POST methods. You can use the `@require_POST` decorator to make sure only POST requests are allowed for that URL:

```python
from django.views.decorators.http import require_POST

@require_POST
def counter_view(request):
    # Your view logic
```

This method will ensure that the `/counter/` URL handles only POST requests properly.
